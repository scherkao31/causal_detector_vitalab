# Causal detector : detecting causal agent in a simulated piedestrian trajectory

## Generate the Data file

This work has been done using generated data from RVO2 based simulator. The labels and framework of the data come from the following github repo,  taht contains the codebase to create and visualizes the synthetic dataset with causality labels (Synth v1), generated using a modified version of the RVO2 simulator.

Our work has been done on the synth_v1.a.filtered.pkl file from the precedent repo. You can download it following the instructions or generate your own scenes. The repo is very well documented and self explenatory.
